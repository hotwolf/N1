\section{Stacks}
\label{stacks}

The N1 operates with two stacks: the \gls{ps} to perform data transactions and the
\gls{rs} to manage the program flow. As illustrated in \figref{stacks:fig}, each of
these stacks consists of three segments: the \gls{us}, the \gls{is}, and the \gls{ls}.

\subsection{Parameter Stack}
\label{stacks:ps}

The \glslink{us}{upper} \gls{ps} holds the four topmost data entries.
Its purpose is to perform stack and \gls{alu} operations
(see \secref{opcodes:stack} and \secref{opcodes:alu}).
When the capacity of the \gls{us} is exceeded, older data entries are shifted
to the \gls{is}.

The \gls{is} serves as a buffer between the \gls{us} and the \gls{ls}, which resides
in \gls{ram}. The purpose of the \gls{is} is to minimize \gls{ram} traffic to and
from the \gls{ls}.
Push operations to the \gls{is} are only propagated to the \gls{ls} when the buffer
capacity is exceeded. Pull operations are only propagated when the \gls{is} is empty.
\Gls{stack} fluctuations within the \gls{is}'s capacity are not visible to the \gls{ls}.

The \gls{ls} is a region of the \gls{ram}, which is managed by a memory controller
that is shared by the \gls{ps} and the \gls{rs}. Within the RAM, both stacks will
grow towards each other. Moving cell content from one stack to the other (\texttt{>R} 
or \texttt{R>}) will never lead to a stack overflow. 

\subsection{Return Stack Stack}
\label{stacks:ps}

The \gls{us} of the \gls{ps} has the capacity of one \gls{cell}. The \gls{is} and
\gls{ls} are identical to the ones of the \gls{ps}.
