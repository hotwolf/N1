\section{Stacks}
\label{stacks}

The N1 operates with two stacks: the \gls{ps} to perform data transactions and the
\gls{rs} to manage the program flow. As illustrated in \figref{stacks:fig}, each of
these stacks consists of three hardware components: the \gls{us}, the \gls{is},
and the \gls{ls}.

\subsection{Parameter Stack}
\label{stacks:ps}

The \gls{us} of the \gls{ps} contains is four \glspl{cell} deep and contains the
most recent data entries. It's purpose is to perform stack and ALU operations
(see \secref{opcodes:stack} and \secref{opcodes:alu}).
When the capacity of the \gls{us} is exceeded, older data entries are transferred
to the \gls{is}.

The \gls{is} serves as a buffer between the \gls{us} and the \gls{ls} which resides
in \gls{ram}. The purpose of the \gls{is} is to minimize \gls{ram} traffic to and
from the \gls{ls}.
Push operation to the \gls{is} are only propagated to the \gls{ls}, when the buffer
capacity is exceeded. Pull operations are onle propagated, when the \gls{is} is empty.
\Gls{stack} fluctuations within the buffer capacity are not visible to the \gls{ls}.

The \gls{ls} is a region of the \gls{ram}, which is managed by the memory controller
of the \gls{is}.

\subsection{Return Stack Stack}
\label{stacks:ps}

The \gls{us} of the \gls{ps} has the capacity of one \gls{cell}. The \gls{is} and
\gls{ls} are similar to the ones of the \gls{ps}.
